prout
=====

_"Has your pull request been deployed yet?"_

Tells you when your pull-requests are live - tells you when they're not, and should be.

Configuration
-------------

* .prout.json in the root of your project
* Add callbacks to prout - ie a GitHub webhook and ideally also a post-deploy hook

Run your own instance of prout
